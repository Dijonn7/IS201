            <p>This is my wife and I. We are very happy. We have been married for 7 months and we are enjoying it! We  are both students at BYU, <br>
            she is studying Elementary Education while I am studying Business. We are so excited to see what the future brings!</p>

            <p>These lovely people are my awsome In-Laws! I was pretty nervous to join the family at first as they are quite different than my parents, <br>
                however, it has been an amazing to be a part of the Pypers. I've come to love them a lot and really enjoy the differences in personality. <br>
                I hope that I can have a family as wonderful and happy as theirs.</p>

            <p>Here are my amazing parents. They were married in 1994 and have had a wonderful marriage. I have two older brothers who are both married <br>
            with their own families. The cute little girl in the santa hat is Molly, my newest neice that is born to the brother and sister in-law on the right.</p>
